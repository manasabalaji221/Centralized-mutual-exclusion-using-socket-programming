This project can run 3 different clients which can be handled by a server.
To run the project, first the server is to be run and then each of the clients(same instance of Client1 to be run thrice).
Each client is connected with Client using socket and it sends its username to the server.
The clients and server send its messages in HTTP Post formats.
The client can choose whether to make the server wait for some random number of seconds.
This value is passed to the server.
In server, this value is put into a queue, and this is enqueued each time to run the threads in the same order they came in.
After that, the thread is made to sleep for that many seconds.
Additionally, client can also log out from the connection with the server and thus the server closes this socket.
This project runs from the console and GUI.
